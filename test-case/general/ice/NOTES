The position of the ice is set to fit on the kaom surface. 
To change to rotation, you can used the command available in GROMACS
    "gmx editconf -f Ih100_162.gro -o rotated.gro -rotate 0 0 60"
This will change the seed along the z axis by 60 degree counterclockwise

To change the position
    "gmx editconf -f Ih100_162.gro -o rotated.gro -translate 1 1 1"
This will change the seed x, y, and z position by +1nm.
